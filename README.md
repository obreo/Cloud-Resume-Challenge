# My Resume Challenge
#### Description: Implementing my resume challenge using on AWS Cloud

## Intro
I created a resume page and deployed it on AWS Cloud - using IaC; Terraform - as a S3 static website.

This project used DynamoDB with lambda to put & get the number of visitor with every access done to the website. 

To make this possible, I used an API gateway to trigger the lambda function whenever traffic occures in the resume page.
